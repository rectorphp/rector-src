## How to Contribute

Contributions here are more than welcomed! You can contribute to [rector-src](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector-src) repository.

There 3 rules will highly increase changes to get your PR merged:

- **1 feature per pull-request**
- **new features need tests**
- CI must pass... you can mimic it locally by running

    ```bash
    composer complete-check
    ```

- Do you need to fix coding standards?

    ```bash
    composer fix-cs
    ```

We would be happy to accept PRs that follow these guidelines.
