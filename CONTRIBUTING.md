# How to Contribute

Contributions here are more than welcomed! You can contribute to [rector-src](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector-src) repository or one of [extension packages](https://github.com/rectorphp/).

## Preparing Local Environment

1. Fork the [rector/rector-src](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector-src) repository and clone it

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rectorphp/rector-src.git
cd rector-src
```

2. We use PHP 8.1 and composer

Verify your local environment and update dependencies:

```bash
composer check-platform-reqs
composer update
```

*Note: using Docker for contributing is strongly discouraged, as it requires [extra knowledge of composer internals](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/9368#issuecomment-718112361).*

Then you can start working with the code :+1:

Do you want to **contribute a failing test**? [This tutorial will sow you how](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/main/docs/how_to_add_test_for_rector_rule.md)

## Preparing Pull Request

There 3 steps will make your pull-request easy to merge:

- **1 feature per pull-request**
- **new features need tests**
- CI must pass... you can mimic it locally by running

    ```bash
    composer complete-check
    ```

- Do you need to fix coding standards?

    ```bash
    composer fix-cs
    ```

We would be happy to accept PRs that follow these guidelines.
